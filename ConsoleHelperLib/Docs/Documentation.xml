        Writes character and color attribute data to a specified rectangular block of character cells
        in a console screen buffer. The data to be written is taken from a correspondingly sized rectangular
        block at a specified location in the source buffer.

          <paramref name="hConsoleOutput"/>:
          A handle to the console screen buffer. The handle must have the <b>GENERIC_WRITE</b> access right.
